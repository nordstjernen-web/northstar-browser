Significant changes in each release:

1.0.5:
======
* Text now wraps around floats the way CSS 2.1 §9.5 describes. Floats
  intrude into the line boxes of nested blocks in the same block
  formatting context, and an inline run that crosses the bottom of a
  float is split so the lines below it reclaim the full width — a long
  paragraph next to a short floated image no longer stays in a narrow
  column all the way down.
* Only tables, block-level replaced elements and boxes that establish a
  new block formatting context are moved aside by a float. Every other
  in-flow block keeps its containing block's width and overlaps the
  float, so backgrounds, borders and percentage widths next to a float
  resolve against the right width.
* CSS `display` is now a structured computed value (outer type, inner
  type, list-item flag, layout-internal kind) instead of a keyword string.
  Two-value syntax such as `display: flow-root list-item` reaches layout
  correctly; previously such elements lost their boxes. `-webkit-box` and
  `-webkit-inline-box` map to flex and inline-flex.
* Anonymous table boxes are generated around any run of table-internal
  siblings, so `display: table-row` and `display: table-row-group` outside
  a table lay out as tables instead of collapsing into surrounding text.
* Blockification follows the spec: the root element blockifies
  (`display: contents` on `<html>` computes to `block`) and flex and grid
  items report their blockified `display` to script, including items
  nested inside a `display: contents` wrapper.
* Cascade layers are ordered as a tree rather than by first-declaration
  order across the whole document: sublayers sort inside their parent, a
  layer's own declarations act as its implicit final sublayer, and nested
  anonymous layers stay nested instead of escaping to the top level.
* The incremental restyle pass identifies stylesheets by a parse-time
  serial instead of by address. A reparsed `<style>` reusing the freed
  block of the sheet it replaced could look unchanged and leave stale
  styles behind.
* `@scope` preludes are parsed against the grammar and invalid ones drop
  the rule; the prelude is serialized canonically.
* `StyleSheet.media` is a live `MediaList` that writes back to the owner
  node's `media` attribute.
