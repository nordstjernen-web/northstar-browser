# Security policy

Northstar is a small independent web browser. Security fixes ship from
`main`; only the latest tagged release is supported.

## Reporting
Report security issues by e-mail to:  andreas.rosdal@hotmail.com

Please include the version (shown in the About Northstar dialog),
your OS, a minimal reproducer (URL or self-contained HTML), and your
assessment of the impact.

## Threat model

Northstar treats the Internet with the utmost suspicion. The attacker
controls fetched HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, WebAssembly and
media. The user, the kernel, and the local filesystem outside the sandbox
allow-list are trusted.

**In scope**

- Memory-safety bugs in our C code: out-of-bounds reads/writes,
  use-after-free, integer overflow, format-string.
- Linux sandbox escapes — both layers: the Landlock filesystem
  allow-list and the seccomp-bpf syscall allow-list.
- macOS Seatbelt write-confinement bypass.
- Windows process-mitigation bypass — the policies set via
  `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` at startup (forced image relocation, strict
  handle checks, extension-point disable, image-load restrictions,
  child-process block, and in headless runs the dynamic-code ban).
- Same-origin, iframe-sandbox, cookie, and HTTP-cache partitioning bypass.
- HSTS, mixed-content, and CSP enforcement bypass, for the parts this
  document says are enforced.
- URL-bar spoofing (IDN homograph, userinfo, scheme confusion, etc.).

**Out of scope**

- Bugs in third-party libraries (libcurl, GTK 4, GLib, lexbor, QuickJS,
  Wuffs, …). Report upstream; we update when fixes ship.
- Features we deliberately don't implement: WebGL, WebGPU, WebRTC,
  adaptive streaming, EME/DRM, JIT, and "AI" web APIs.
- CPU-level side channels (Spectre-class).
- Attacks that already require local code execution as the same user.
- The gaps listed under *Known gaps* below, which are known and tracked.

## Defenses

This minimalist edition runs **single-process**: the HTML/CSS/JS/layout
engine parses and renders untrusted content in the GTK shell process
itself, on a dedicated engine thread. There is no separate renderer
executable and no per-tab renderer process — every page shares one OS
process and one address space. The audio decoders and SDL2 mixer also run
in that browser process on a worker thread (see *Media*, below).

Because there is no privilege boundary between pages, the layered
defenses below are **hardening and containment for the whole process**,
not an inter-process sandbox around a compromised renderer: they shrink
what a memory-safety bug in the engine can reach (filesystem, syscalls,
network protocols), but a bug in the engine is not confined to a
subordinate process the way it would be in a multi-process browser. A
true per-page/per-origin process sandbox is not part of this edition;
treat process isolation as **absent**, and the defenses here as
defence-in-depth around a single trusted-code / untrusted-data boundary.

A normal GUI launch has one more process: the watchdog supervisor
(`src/watchdog.c`), which starts the browser as a child and restarts it on
a crash or hang. The supervisor loads no page content and initialises no
network or UI, and it is **not** sandboxed — it spawns the browser before
any Landlock, seccomp or mitigation policy is applied, so that the child
applies them to itself. `--no-watchdog` or `NS_NO_WATCHDOG` runs the
browser without it; headless and tooling runs never use it.

### Compile-time hardening (`meson.build`)

PIE, full RELRO, non-executable stack, separate-code segments,
`-fstack-protector-strong`, `-fstack-clash-protection`,
`-fcf-protection=full` (Intel CET / AMD IBT), `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`
(`=2` fallback), `-Wformat=2 -Wformat-security`. No JIT is used or
linked — JavaScript runs on the QuickJS interpreter and WebAssembly on
WAMR's classic interpreter — so the browser never needs
writable-and-executable memory. Only headless runs on Windows have the
kernel enforce that (see *Windows process mitigations*); elsewhere it is
a property of the code, and neither the Linux seccomp filter nor the
Windows GUI's mitigations refuse an executable mapping.

On glibc, `mallopt(M_PERTURB)` fills freed and freshly allocated heap
memory with a pattern (`src/security.c`), so a use-after-free or an
uninitialised read sees garbage instead of stale data; the
`harden_allocator` setting (`NS_NO_HARDEN_ALLOC`) turns it off.

### Privilege drop (`src/security.c`)

- Linux/macOS: refuses to start as root — prints a diagnostic and exits
  with status 77 before any page is loaded.
- Windows: when launched elevated it *drops* Administrator rights by
  relaunching itself with the desktop shell's medium-integrity token
  (`CreateProcessWithTokenW`) and exiting the elevated instance, so the
  browsing session runs unprivileged. It verifies the shell token is not
  itself elevated first, so a fully elevated session cannot loop. When
  de-elevation is impossible it falls back to a plain-language dialog
  offering to quit (default) or run as Administrator anyway. Elevation is
  detected with `CheckTokenMembership` against the Built-in
  Administrators SID.
- `NS_ALLOW_ROOT=1` overrides on every platform — keep the elevated
  process and skip the de-elevation and the prompt.
- Sets `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` before installing the seccomp filter, so
  setuid binaries cannot be used to gain privileges after a compromise.

### Linux sandbox

Two confinement layers exist, both default-deny and installed from
`main()` in `src/appmain.c` (via `src/security.c`) before any HTML or
audio is parsed:

| Run mode | Landlock | seccomp-bpf | `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` |
|----------|:--------:|:-----------:|:---------------------:|
| **Interactive GUI** (the normal browser) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Headless / `--dump` / `--eval` / WPT tooling | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Watchdog supervisor (GUI launches only) | — | — | — |

Both layers **fail open**: on a kernel without Landlock, or when the
seccomp filter cannot be loaded, the browser logs the failure and runs
unconfined.

- **Landlock (filesystem) — applied in every browser mode.**
  - *Read + execute:* `/usr`, `/usr/local`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, the
    directory the running executable sits in, and a `../lib` or
    `../lib64` beside it.
  - *Read-only:* `/etc`, the CA-certificate and fontconfig caches,
    `/proc`, `/sys`, `/run`, `/dev/dri`, `/dev/urandom`, the X11 and ICE
    socket directories, the X authority file (`$XAUTHORITY`, or
    `~/.Xauthority` when that is unset) and nothing else in its
    directory, and the per-user configuration the libraries the browser
    loads look for: in the XDG config directory `dconf`, `enchant`,
    `fontconfig`, `glib-2.0`, `gtk-3.0`, `gtk-4.0`, `ibus`, `pipewire`,
    `pulse`, `vulkan`, `mimeapps.list` and `user-dirs.dirs`; in the XDG
    data directory `applications`, `enchant`, `fonts`, `glib-2.0`,
    `icons`, `mime`, `themes` and `vulkan`; in the
    XDG cache directory `fontconfig`, `gtk-4.0`, `mesa_shader_cache`,
    `mesa_shader_cache_db` and `nvidia`; and in the home directory
    `.XCompose`, `.asoundrc`, `.drirc`, `.fontconfig`, `.fonts`,
    `.fonts.conf`, `.fonts.conf.d`, `.icons`, `.nv` and `.themes`. Each
    is granted only if it exists when the browser starts. So are the
    data directories found near the executable (`../share/northstar`, or
    `data/` in a build tree — where the source tree itself, the nearest
    directory holding a `meson.build` up to three levels above the
    executable, is readable too). `/dev/shm` is read-only in headless
    mode.
  - *Read + write:* the per-user runtime directory (which holds the
    Wayland socket), the browser's own state under
    `~/.config/northstar`, `~/.local/share/northstar` and
    `~/.cache/northstar`, the download directory when its path starts
    with `$HOME`, `/dev/null`, `/dev/shm` in GUI mode, `/dev/snd` and any
    `/dev/video0`–`/dev/video63` node that exists, and the output
    directory of a `--dump=png:`, `pdf:` or `print:` run.

  The rest of `$HOME` — `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.netrc`, shell history,
  documents, and other applications' state under `~/.config`,
  `~/.local/share` and `~/.cache` such as other browsers' profiles,
  keyrings and command-line tokens — is **not** reachable, and a save
  dialog GTK draws itself, when no desktop portal is running, can browse
  only the directories above. One thing widens that: without
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, GLib uses `~/.cache` as the runtime directory,
  which is then readable and writable. No writable directory is granted
  Landlock's execute right, and `execve` is not in the seccomp
  allow-list, so a dropped file cannot be run as a program.
  Symbolic-link creation (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM`) is handled by
  the ruleset and granted nowhere, and on Landlock ABI 3+ `truncate(2)`
  is handled and allowed only where file writes are; the ABI is probed
  at startup so the ruleset requests only rights the running kernel
  knows.
- **seccomp-bpf (syscalls) — applied in every browser mode.**
  Default-deny allow-list: the filter is built with
  `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(EPERM)` as the default action and then permits only the
  266 syscalls the browser needs (`ns_seccomp_allowed_names[]` in
  `src/security.c`); every other syscall returns `EPERM`. `execve` /
  `execveat` are not on the list, so a confined process cannot pivot to
  another interpreter or binary even if Landlock would have allowed
  reading it. `ptrace`, `bpf`, `keyctl`, `mount`, `unshare`,
  `userfaultfd`, the `io_uring_*` family, `perf_event_open`, `kexec_load`,
  and the module syscalls are likewise absent. The filter matches syscall
  numbers only, not their arguments: `clone`/`clone3`, `ioctl`, `prctl`,
  `socket`, `mmap` and `mprotect` are allowed with any flags. TSYNC
  propagates the filter to every thread.
- **Media / audio.** Northstar decodes audio **in-tree** in the browser
  process (`src/audio/audio.c`), not via an external player. The media
  controller (`src/js_media.c`) sends each `<audio>` element's commands
  straight to its page's audio context, which the page owns and destroys
  when it closes. An unmuted `autoplay` element starts only after a user
  gesture on the page. A dedicated worker thread fetches and decodes
  media without blocking GTK; URLs are never handed to a shell or an
  external binary. The worker fetches through `net.c` like any other
  subresource of the page — the page's cookie partition, HSTS, the
  request policy below and the response-size cap all apply — and decodes
  from memory, so nothing is written to disk. The engine has already
  checked the source against `media-src` before the command is sent. The
  mixer decodes MP3 (vendored minimp3), MP2 (vendored
  pl_mpeg) and, when `opusfile`/`vorbisfile` are present, Ogg
  Opus/Vorbis, and outputs through SDL2. On Linux the worker inherits the
  browser's Landlock + seccomp restrictions, but codec memory corruption
  is not isolated from the browser address space. Script-supplied media
  bytes (a `MediaSource` buffer, a `blob:` URL) stay in process: the
  engine resolves them to bytes and queues those to the same worker.
- **Video.** `<video>` decodes MPEG-1 (`video/mpeg`) and nothing else,
  through the same vendored pl_mpeg that supplies the MP2 audio decoder
  (`src/video.c`). This is a real codec attack surface, in the browser
  process, with no isolation from it — pl_mpeg is ordinary C, not a
  memory-safe decoder like Wuffs. It is deliberately a small one: one
  decoder for one format, no demuxer beyond MPEG-1 Program Stream, no
  adaptive streaming and no DRM. Frames are decoded up front rather than
  streamed, bounded by `NS_VIDEO_MAX_DIMENSION` (4096 pixels a side),
  `NS_VIDEO_MAX_FRAMES` (4096) and `NS_VIDEO_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` (256 MB of
  decoded pixels), so a crafted clip cannot drive unbounded allocation; a
  longer one is truncated.

`NS_NO_SANDBOX=1` disables both Landlock and seccomp (and the macOS
profile); `NS_NO_SECCOMP=1` disables seccomp alone. Both act on the
variable being set at all, whatever its value. Don't use them in normal
operation.

### macOS sandbox

The macOS build applies a Seatbelt profile with `sandbox_init(3)`. It
allows reads and system interaction by default but denies filesystem
writes, then permits writes to the temporary directories, `/dev`, the
runtime directory, Northstar's config/data/cache directories, Downloads,
and the output directory of a headless dump. This is write confinement,
not the Linux profile's read allow-list or syscall filter; all engine and
audio code still shares the browser process. Set `NS_NO_SANDBOX=1` only
for debugging.

### Windows process mitigations

Windows has no direct Landlock or seccomp-bpf equivalent that a
user-space GTK process can apply to itself. Instead the browser hardens
itself at startup via `SetProcessMitigationPolicy`, called from
`ns_security_win32_mitigations_init` in `src/security.c` before any page
is loaded. Each call is best-effort: a policy the running Windows does not
support returns `FALSE` and is skipped. The policies are named by their
`PROCESS_MITIGATION_POLICY` constants. The browser and headless/tooling
modes apply:

- **ASLR** (`ProcessASLRPolicy`, `EnableForceRelocateImages`) — relocate
  every image that carries relocations, even one built without
  `/DYNAMICBASE`, so no DLL loads at a predictable address. Stripped
  images are still allowed, since refusing them could stop a system or
  third-party DLL loading; bottom-up and high-entropy randomisation come
  from the executable's own PE header.
- **StrictHandleCheck** (`ProcessStrictHandleCheckPolicy`, flags
  `0x03`) — raise an exception on invalid handle use and lock the
  setting permanently. Catches double-close, UAF-of-handle bugs.
- **DisableExtensionPoints**
  (`ProcessExtensionPointDisablePolicy`, flags `0x01`) — block
  `AppInit_DLLs`, WinSock Layered Service Providers, Image File
  Execution Options debuggers, and a few other legacy injection
  vectors that load DLLs into every process on the box.
- **ImageLoad restrictions** (`ProcessImageLoadPolicy`, flags
  `0x07`) — `NoRemoteImages` (no DLL loads from UNC/mapped
  network drives), `NoLowMandatoryLabelImages` (no DLL loads from
  Low-IL filesystem locations), `PreferSystem32Images` (resolve
  ambiguous DLL names against system32 first). Mitigates DLL
  planting and search-order hijacks.
- **ChildProcess block** (`ProcessChildProcessPolicy`, flags
  `0x01`) — no `CreateProcess` from this process, so a compromised
  process cannot directly pivot to `cmd.exe` / `powershell` / another
  binary. The watchdog launches the browser before this policy is applied;
  the browser process itself has no legitimate child-process requirement.

Headless and tooling runs also apply **DisableDynamicCode**
(`ProcessDynamicCodePolicy`, `ProhibitDynamicCode`): the kernel refuses
any request for executable memory that was not mapped from an image, so
an exploit cannot allocate a writable-and-executable buffer. The
interactive browser does not, because it loads code it does not control
— GPU drivers that compile shaders at run time, and the shell extensions
and input methods that native file dialogs and text input bring in — and
that code may need executable memory of its own.

There is no per-path filesystem sandbox; Windows AppContainer
would provide one but requires a manifest and code-signing
integration we don't have yet. The closest equivalents — Low
Integrity Level drop and AppContainer — are tracked as future
work.

The whole mitigation suite can be disabled for debugging with
`NS_NO_WIN32_MITIGATIONS=1`. Don't use that in normal operation.

### Network

libcurl drives every page fetch with TLS verification enabled
(`CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER=1`, `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST=2`), `http`,
`https` and `ftp` as the only protocols, redirects clamped to HTTPS once
the initial scheme is HTTPS (and to FTP once it is FTP), at most ten
redirects, an explicit response-size cap, and `CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL`. HSTS
state is loaded and persisted via `CURLOPT_HSTS`; Alt-Svc is honoured.
Top-level navigations try HTTPS first (`https_first`, on by default).
The `tls_allow_insecure_override` setting, off by default, lets the user
proceed past a certificate error, never for an HSTS host.

Every subresource request passes one policy check,
`ns_fetch_policy_check` (`src/fetch_policy.c`), before it is sent and
again at every redirect hop. The request carries its destination
(script, stylesheet, image, font, media, frame, worker, connection) and
the policy of the document that made it: that document's URL and a
snapshot of its Content-Security-Policy. The check applies, in order:

- **Local files.** A `file:` URL is refused unless the requesting
  document is itself a `file:` document.
- **Mixed content.** An `http:` or `ws:` URL requested by an `https:`
  document is refused, except that images and media are upgraded to
  `https:` (with no fallback if the upgrade fails), and a loopback host
  (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) counts as secure.
- **CSP by destination.** `img-src`, `media-src`, `font-src`,
  `connect-src`, `worker-src` and `frame-src`, each with its CSP
  fallback chain, are checked against the (possibly upgraded) URL.
  Scripts and stylesheets are checked where the element is, because a
  nonce, a hash or `'strict-dynamic'` decides them.

Requests that share an in-flight fetch or a preloaded response have the
final URL checked against their own policy when the response arrives.
WebSocket, EventSource, `sendBeacon`, worker scripts and the audio
worker use the same check.

### Origin isolation

- Cookies and the HTTP cache are partitioned per top-level **site**
  (scheme + registrable domain + port), where the registrable domain
  comes from the Public Suffix List via libpsl. All subdomains within
  the same registrable domain share one cookie jar and one cache
  partition; everything else is isolated. Third-party cookies are
  blocked on network requests by default (`cookie_policy`). A
  subresource keeps its initiating document through every redirect hop,
  so a 302 cannot move it into the target's first-party partition or
  relabel it as a navigation in the `Sec-Fetch-*` headers.
- `about:settings`, `about:config` and `about:history` are served only
  to navigations and to requests made by about: pages; the settings
  endpoints accept changes only by POST, validate the URLs they store,
  and web content cannot navigate to any about: page other than
  `about:blank` and the start page.
- A `file:` document may embed local files as images, scripts,
  stylesheets and frames, but `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` receive
  only an opaque response for a `file:` URL, directory listings are
  synthesized only for navigations, and an `http(s)` page cannot navigate
  to, or play media from, a `file:` URL.
- CSP (`src/csp.c`) is parsed from headers and `<meta>` and enforced for
  `default-src` (as the fallback), `script-src` (inline and external,
  with nonces, hashes and `'strict-dynamic'`), `connect-src`,
  `frame-src`/`child-src`, `worker-src`, `img-src`, `media-src`,
  `font-src`, `frame-ancestors`, `object-src`, `base-uri` and
  `form-action`, including on redirects. `style-src` is parsed but not
  enforced when parser-inserted stylesheets load (it only withholds a
  `<link>` element's `load` event). Host
  source expressions match scheme, host (with `*.` wildcard), port
  (defaulting to the scheme's default), and path (left-anchored if the
  source ends in `/`, exact otherwise). `*` follows CSP3 semantics — it
  matches network schemes only, never `data:`, `blob:`, `filesystem:`,
  or `javascript:`.
- Subresource Integrity (`integrity="sha256-…"` / `sha384-` / `sha512-`)
  is verified against the response body before a script runs.
  Stylesheets' `integrity` attributes are not checked.
- The address bar shows the URL in its WHATWG-serialised form, in which
  a non-ASCII host always appears as its punycode (`xn--…`) encoding, and
  drops any `user:password@` part of the authority. A look-alike
  internationalised domain therefore never displays as the Latin name it
  imitates.
- Service-worker registrations and interception are restricted to the
  script's origin; a worker cannot control an unrelated origin. The
  `Service-Worker-Allowed` path restriction on scope is not enforced.
- WebExtensions are explicitly installed local code, not capabilities
  granted to web pages. Packaged-resource paths are canonicalized beneath
  the extension root before loading, and extension storage is separated by
  extension identity.
- Safe browsing (`src/safebrowsing.c`) checks a top-level navigation's
  host against a local SHA-256 blocklist (the bundled
  `safebrowsing.list`, a user list in the config directory, or
  `NS_SAFEBROWSING_LIST`) and shows an interstitial. It is a warning, not
  a boundary: the interstitial's continue link is an ordinary special URL
  that a page could also link to.
- Downloads are marked with their origin — the `com.apple.quarantine`
  attribute on macOS, `user.xdg.origin.url` on Linux, and a
  `Zone.Identifier` stream on Windows — and an `<a download>` link starts
  one only after a recent user gesture.

### On-disk state

Config, cookies, cache, HSTS, Alt-Svc, bookmarks, history,
service-worker registrations, and WebExtension local storage live under
the application data directories with owner-only permissions (`0700`
directories, `0600` files on Unix). On Windows the HTTP cache directory
gets an explicit owner-only ACL; the other files inherit the user
profile's default ACL. Service-worker registrations are keyed by origin
and scope and are not persisted in private mode. Extension storage is
keyed by extension identity and stays memory-only in private mode. The
HTTP cache is keyed on `SHA-256(URL || partition)`, so cache filenames
never embed attacker-controlled bytes and no path-traversal is possible.

### Parsers

- HTML is parsed exclusively by [lexbor](https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor);
  there is no hand-rolled HTML tokenizer. XML and XHTML go through the
  engine's own `src/xml.c`, which caps internal-entity expansion at 1 MB
  per document.
- URL parsing routes through lexbor's WHATWG URL module.
- PNG/APNG, GIF, BMP, JPEG and WebP bytes are decoded by
  [Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs) (memory-safe,
  transpiled-to-C). ICO is unwrapped in `image_ico.c` and handed to
  Wuffs; SVG is rendered in-engine; AVIF goes to libavif when the build
  has it, which is the one image path that is neither memory-safe nor
  in-tree — `-Davif=disabled` removes it. Nothing else decodes images:
  there is no GDK-Pixbuf fallback and no plugin-loaded decoder, so the
  set of parsers exposed to untrusted bytes is fixed at build time.
- Web fonts, WOFF included, are parsed by FreeType; the engine then
  re-serialises a WOFF font's tables as a plain SFNT file (`src/font.c`).
- WebAssembly modules are parsed and run by the vendored WAMR classic
  interpreter (`src/wamr/`), which is ordinary C parsing untrusted bytes.
- Charset sniffing is delegated to uchardet, not hand-rolled.
- The engine's own parsers bound attacker-controlled nesting and sizes.
  The recursive CSS parsers — selectors, `@supports`, `@media` queries,
  `var()` fallbacks, and `color-mix()` — all carry depth caps, the
  background-layer list is torn down iteratively, layout's box-tree
  walkers stop at a fixed depth, and SVG rendering stops at 256 levels,
  so a pathologically nested stylesheet or DOM cannot exhaust the stack.
  Decoded image and video dimensions are clamped before any
  `width × height` multiplication, so a crafted dimension cannot
  integer-overflow a bounds check or allocation. `filter: blur()`
  likewise clamps its radius before building the convolution window.

### JavaScript

JavaScript runs in [QuickJS](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs), an
interpreter — no JIT, no machine-code generation. The DOM/JS bridge
invalidates opaque pointers on node free and re-validates on every
call, so DOM mutation cannot dangle a JS-held handle. A page's runtime
is created with a memory limit (`js_memory_cap_mb`, 2 GiB by default)
and a 5 MiB stack limit; a worker's runtime gets 256 MiB, and at most
512 MiB.

All pages run in **one OS process** (single-process edition) — there is
no per-page process or address-space isolation, so this is a
JavaScript-state boundary, not a memory boundary. Every top-level
navigation builds a new document with a fresh QuickJS runtime, whatever
the origin, so attacker-controlled globals (`window.foo = secret;`),
prototype pollution, leftover module state, and any other in-memory JS
residue from a previous page cannot reach the next page's scripts. The
page being left is freed, or suspended in the back/forward cache (up to
four pages) with its runtime intact. Because
everything shares one process, a memory-safety bug in the engine is
**not** contained between pages the way it would be with separate
renderer processes; the separate runtimes defend against JS-level state
leakage, not against native memory corruption.

Iframes are rendered. An `<iframe src>` is fetched through the same
network pipeline as any other resource (TLS verification, redirect
clamp, response-size cap, CSP `frame-src`); `srcdoc` is parsed inline.
The content document is parsed by lexbor and laid out in place.

A loaded frame gets its own JavaScript realm (a `JSContext`), but
**within the parent page's single QuickJS runtime** — there is no
separate runtime or OS process per frame, and the frame shares the
parent's DOM class prototypes. The frame sees its own `window`,
`document`, `location` and `history`. A same-origin frame's `parent` and
`top` are the embedding page's real window, as the web platform
requires. A frame whose URL is cross-origin, or one sandboxed without
`allow-same-origin`, instead gets a restricted window proxy for `parent`
and `top` — `postMessage`, the `location` setter, `closed`, `length`,
`window`/`self`/`frames`/`parent`/`top` and `close`/`focus`/`blur`;
anything else throws `SecurityError` — and the embedding page sees
`contentDocument` as `null` and a restricted `contentWindow` in the
other direction. A frame's origin is that of the URL it finally loads,
after redirects.

Because every frame realm lives in the parent's runtime, the frame's
global object is assembled from the parent's: it receives copies of the
parent window's properties. For a cross-origin frame that copy is
limited to the browser's own globals, captured before the page's scripts
run, so the page's variables never reach it, and the parent-bound
`cookieStore`, `caches`, `getSelection`, `opener`, `frameElement`,
`name`, `origin` and `navigation` are replaced or left out. Nodes and
ranges a frame constructs (`new Text()`, `new Comment()`, `new Range()`,
custom elements) belong to the frame's document, and each document has
its own custom element registry, so a definition made in one document
never upgrades elements of another. Documents without a browsing context
(`DOMParser`, `createHTMLDocument`, `cloneNode`) are cookie-averse.

This is a JavaScript-level boundary for ordinary
content, **not** a hard security boundary: a memory-safety bug or a
Proxy escape in one frame is not contained from the rest of the page.
Treat frame isolation as defence-in-depth, not as an origin sandbox.

The `sandbox` attribute is parsed and enforced, with nested frames
inheriting the intersection of their ancestors' sandboxes:

- No `allow-scripts` blocks the frame's scripts from running at all.
- No `allow-same-origin` makes the frame opaque-origin: `localStorage`,
  `sessionStorage` and `indexedDB` throw `SecurityError`,
  `document.cookie` reads empty and ignores writes, and the frame and its
  embedder reach each other only through the restricted window proxies
  above.
- No `allow-forms` blocks form submission; no `allow-modals` neutralises
  `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt`/`print`; no `allow-popups` makes
  `window.open` return `null`.

A plain `<iframe>` with no `sandbox` attribute runs its scripts.

Cross-document `postMessage` is delivered in both directions between a
frame and its parent. `targetOrigin` is parsed to scheme, host and port
and compared for equality with the recipient window's origin (`/` means
the sender's own origin and `*` matches everything); the message is
dropped on a mismatch. A message sent through a restricted window proxy
carries the sender's origin and window proxy as the event's `origin` and
`source`. Delivery is asynchronous, through the job queue. What this is
not is a memory boundary: sender and recipient share one QuickJS runtime,
so `postMessage` is the ordinary channel between frames, not a
containment mechanism.

### Cookies and the `document.cookie` surface

Network cookies live in libcurl's per-site cookie jar on disk. They
are parsed, scoped, and re-sent by libcurl, honouring `HttpOnly`,
`Secure`, `SameSite`, `Path`, `Domain`, and expiry. At navigation the
non-`HttpOnly` cookies for the document's origin are read back out of
the jar (`ns_net_cookies_for_js`) and seeded into `document.cookie`,
and the `document.cookie` setter writes back into that same per-site
jar (`ns_net_cookie_store_from_js`) — so a cookie set from JS is sent
on the next request, and a cookie set over the network is visible to a
later `document.cookie` read. `HttpOnly` cookies are written by libcurl
with a `#HttpOnly_` line prefix that the JS read path skips, so they
stay invisible to script. Script writes and network transfers go through
one cookie store per site, guarded by a lock; only that store writes the
jar file.

The `document.cookie` setter:

- Caps input length at 4 KiB.
- Requires a non-empty `name`.
- Maintains an in-memory mirror for synchronous read-back, then
  persists to the network jar.
- Parses attributes after the first `;`. `Max-Age` (seconds) and
  `Expires` (HTTP-date, via `curl_getdate`) set the jar expiry;
  `Max-Age<=0` or a past `Expires` deletes the named cookie. `Secure`
  is rejected outright from non-HTTPS origins. `Domain` is range-checked
  against the document host before it widens scope, and a public-suffix
  `Domain` is refused; absent, the cookie is stored host-only. `Path`
  defaults to the RFC 6265 default-path of the document URL.
- Enforces the `__Secure-` and `__Host-` name-prefix rules.
- Refuses a name that collides with an `HttpOnly` cookie for the
  document host in the site's jar, so script cannot add a second value
  beside a server session cookie.

## Known gaps

- **No process isolation between pages — single-process edition.** The
  engine parses and renders all untrusted content in the one browser
  process; there is no per-tab, per-page, or per-origin renderer process.
  A memory-safety bug in the engine is therefore not contained to a
  subordinate process — the origin/cookie/CSP/cache boundaries are
  enforced in-process by the engine's own logic, and the sandbox
  (Landlock and seccomp) limits what the whole process can reach, but
  neither is a substitute for the address-space isolation a
  multi-process browser gives you. A per-page process sandbox is the
  largest single hardening this edition does not have.
- **Iframe isolation is JS-level, not a runtime or process boundary.**
  A loaded frame shares the parent page's QuickJS runtime and DOM
  prototypes; its restricted window proxies are a JavaScript boundary,
  not a true cross-origin sandbox. A per-origin/per-frame runtime would
  close this and is tracked as future work; until then, do not rely on
  a cross-origin frame being contained from the embedding origin. Known
  seams of the shared runtime: the engine keeps one "current URL", so
  while a frame's script is running a parent callback that runs in the
  same turn sees the frame's URL as its own `location`, and a frame's
  `performance` entries include the embedding page's resource timings.
- **`document.cookie` in a frame uses the frame's own site.** A
  cross-site frame reads and writes its site's first-party jar through
  `document.cookie`, so the third-party blocking that applies to network
  requests does not apply to script, and the `cookie_policy` setting is
  not consulted for script writes.
- **`style-src` for parser-inserted stylesheets and stylesheet SRI are
  not enforced**, as described under *Origin isolation*.
- **In-process codecs.** MPEG-1 video, MP2/MP3/Ogg audio, AVIF (when
  built) and WebAssembly are ordinary C parsing attacker-controlled bytes
  in the browser process (see *Media*). They are bounded, but nothing
  stands between them and the rest of the process.
- **Linux: without `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` the cache directory is writable.**
  GLib then falls back to `~/.cache` as the runtime directory, which the
  browser needs to write, so other applications' caches are readable and
  writable in that case.
- **Windows: no per-path filesystem sandbox, and no dynamic-code ban in
  the GUI.** The mitigation suite restricts the *process* (no remote DLL
  loads, no child processes, etc.) but does not allow-list the files the
  process can read or write the way Landlock does on Linux, and the
  interactive browser leaves executable memory allowed for GPU drivers
  and shell extensions (see *Windows process mitigations*). AppContainer
  or a Low-Integrity-Level drop would close the first; both require
  additional integration work (manifest / capability declarations /
  re-routed config paths) and are tracked as future work.
- **The cookie jar is not locked between browser instances.** Within one
  process, script and network cookie writes are serialised; two
  Northstar processes sharing a profile can still lose each other's
  writes.
